# # Heart Disease Mortality Trend Analysis (2015-2021)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on heart disease mortality trends in the U.S. from 2015 to 2021. Using publicly available datasets, we analyze patterns, identify key risk factors, and visualize insights to support better public health interventions.

## 📊 Key Features

- **Dataset Inspection**: Understanding data structure, missing values, and preprocessing.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring consistency.
- **Trend Analysis**: Studying changes in heart disease mortality over time.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting and selecting meaningful features.
- **Model Predictions**: Forecasting mortality rates using Machine Learning (Random Forest Regressor).
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Providing actionable insights for policymakers and healthcare professionals.

## 📂 Dataset Sources

The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from Data.gov:

- 2015-2017 Heart Disease Mortality
- 2017-2019 Heart Disease Mortality
- 2019-2021 Heart Disease Mortality

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
- Jupyter Notebook for EDA and visualization
- GitHub for version control

## 📈 Analysis Steps

1. **Data Inspection**: Understanding dataset structure, missing values, and descriptive statistics.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, renaming columns, and standardizing data.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Visualizing mortality trends by state, gender, and time period.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting key attributes influencing mortality rates.
5. **Model Prediction**: Training a Random Forest model to forecast future mortality trends.
6. **Evaluation & Insights**: Using RMSE, MAE, and R² to validate model performance and provide recommendations.

## 📌 Key Insights

- **States with highest mortality rates**: Guam, American Samoa, Oklahoma, Nevada, and Michigan.
- **States with lowest mortality rates**: Massachusetts, Minnesota, Puerto Rico, Oregon, and Virginia.
- **Gender Disparities**: Male mortality rates are consistently higher than female rates.
- **Increasing Trends**: Certain states show a rising trend in mortality, indicating a need for targeted interventions.

## 📜 Results & Findings

- **Best-Performing Model**: Random Forest Regressor achieved an R² score of 0.82.
- **Predictions for 2022-2026**: Forecasted mortality trends suggest targeted public health measures are needed in high-risk regions.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Implementing deep learning models for more accurate predictions.
- Expanding the analysis to county-level insights.
- Investigating the impact of social determinants on heart disease mortality.
